            Hi there! My full name is KARIMOVA XABIBA ANVAROVNA. It's just a simple portfolio of mine. I mean, it's my first portfolio website and a bit incomplete.
            But I try my best to improve it. I hope you'll like it. <br /><br />
          
            A little bit about me:
            <br/> 
            Firstly, I'm very keen on programming, and at the moment,  
            I'm learning  ReactJS. Apart from that, I know HTML, Css and a little bit JavaScript programming languages.
            What's more, I'm curious about cybersecurity, computer science, science, actually, everything in this universe.
            I'm learning them little by little, too. But I need to make more progress. That's why, 
            I need someone who can teach me them. 
            <br/><br />

             By the way, I'm also IELTS 7.5 band score achiever.
             <br/>
